# ErgoBot
Discord bot written for my own server.

I'll keep adding functionalities when I have the time and resources

Functionalities so far:
 - ```!safkaa``` Fetches cafeteria lunch menus at my campus

## Installation
Clone the repository, navigate to root directory of the repo.

Create ```auth.json``` file and paste this template to it:
```
  {
    token: {TOKEN}
  }
```
Replace the {TOKEN} with the Token the Discord Developer Portal provides you with.

Then, open command line and type:
```
  npm install
```

After this, you should be able to run the app from the command line with the command
```
  node bot.js
```
